                        When two students are presented with an opportunity to spend a semester in any one of the 15 different sites NYU offers, they have to chose their paths -- a choice that will define their next 5 months. In a university with no limits, they build their own experiences, but with greap power comes great responsibility.

                        <i>Abroad</i> is an adventure film looking into the lives of two girls at NYU Abu Dhabi and New York City campuses. It reflects the unique ability of NYU to go to the same university but live in two oppposite sides of the world.
